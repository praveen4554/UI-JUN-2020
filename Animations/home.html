                            <td>The emperor penguin is the largest and heaviest species of penguin, growing up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall. It is the only species of penguin to breed during the Antarctic winter.</td>

                            <td>The male protects the egg on top of its feet throughout the coldest months of winter while the female goes off to feed. Graceful swimmers, emperors gets about on the ice by sliding on their bellies. </td>

                            <td>The emperor penguin's feathers, together with a thick layer of fat under its skin, provide most of the protection it needs from the cold. Muscles hold the feathers erect when on land, trapping a layer of air next to the skin, giving additional insulation.</td>
                            <td>Many sea birds gather in large colonies to breed, often laying just one egg.</td>
